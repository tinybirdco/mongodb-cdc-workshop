# Tinybird Workshop on ingesting MongoDB CDC events

This repository is a companion piece to the 'MongoDB CDC' workshop. The intended audience of this workshop are folks who have MongoDB data and are interested in streaming that data to Tinybird.

In this workshop we start with a MongoDB Atlas instance with a `weather-reports` collection in a `weather-data` database.
